<h3>Vulnerability Scanning Overview</h3>

As discussed earlier, vulnerability scanning is performed to identify potential vulnerabilities in network devices such as routers, firewalls, switches, as well as servers, workstations, and applications. Scanning is automated and focuses on finding potential/known vulnerabilities on the network or at the application level. Vulnerabilities scanners typically do not exploit vulnerabilities (with some exceptions) but need a human to manually validate scan issues to determine whether or not a particular scan returned real issues that need to be fixed or false positives that can be ignored and excluded from future scans against the same target.

Vulnerability scanning is often part of a standard penetration test, but the two are not the same. A vulnerability scan can help gain additional coverage during a penetration test or speed up the project's testing under time constraints. An actual penetration test includes much more than just a scan.

The type of scans run varies from one tool to another, but most tools run a combination of dynamic and static tests, depending on the target and the vulnerability. A static test would determine a vulnerability if the identified version of a particular asset has a public CVE. However, this is not always accurate as a patch may have been applied, or the target isn't specifically vulnerable to that CVE. On the other hand, a dynamic test tries specific (usually benign) payloads such as weak credentials, SQL injection, or command injection on the target (i.e., a web application). If any payload returns a hit, then there's a good chance that it is vulnerable.

Organizations should run both unauthenticated and authenticated scans on a continuous schedule to ensure that assets are patched as new vulnerabilities are discovered and that any new assets added to the network do not have missing patches or other configuration/patching issues. Vulnerability scanning should feed into an organization's patch management program.

Nessus, Qualys, and Nexpose are well-known vulnerability scanning platforms. While Nessus and Qualys offer free community editions, Nexpose provides a 30-day trial edition, allowing users to explore its features before committing to a purchase. Additionally, there are open-source alternatives such as OpenVAS.

<h3>Nessus Overview</h3>

Nessus Essentials by Tenable is the free version of the official Nessus Vulnerability Scanner. Individuals can access Nessus Essentials to get started understanding Tenable's vulnerability scanner. The caveat is that it can only be used for up to 16 hosts. The features in the free version are limited but are perfect for someone looking to get started with Nessus. The free scanner will attempt to identify vulnerabilities in an environment.

<h3>OpenVAS Overview</h3>

OpenVAS by Greenbone Networks is a publicly available open-source vulnerability scanner. OpenVAS can perform network scans, including authenticated and unauthenticated testing.
