<h3>Working with Nessus Scan Output</h3>

Nessus gives us the option to export scan results in a variety of report formats as well as the option to export raw Nessus scan results to be imported into other tools, archived, or passed to tools, such as EyeWitness, which can be used to take screenshots of all web applications identified by Nessus and greatly assist us with working through the results and finding more value in them.

<h3>Nessus Reports</h3>

Once a scan is completed we can choose to export a report in .pdf, .html, or .csv formats. The .pdf and .html reports give the option for either an Executive Summary or a custom report. The Executive Summary report provides a listing of hosts, a total number of vulnerabilities discovered per host, and a Show Details option to see the severity, CVSS score, plugin number, and name of each discovered issue. The plugin number contains a link to the full plugin writeup from the Tenable plugin database. The PDF option provides the scan results in a format that is easier to share. The CSV report option allows us to select which columns we would like to export. This is particularly useful if importing the scan results into another tool such as Splunk if a document needs to be shared with many internal stakeholders responsible for remediation of the various assets scanned or to perform analytics on the scan data.

Note: These scan reports should only be shared as either an appendix or supplementary data to a custom penetration test/vulnerability assessment report. They should not be given to a client as the final deliverable for any assessment type.

An example of the HTML report is shown below:

It is best to always make sure the vulnerabilities are grouped together for a clear understanding of each issue and the assets affected.

<h3>Exporting Nessus Scans</h3>

Nessus also gives the option to export scans into two formats Nessus (scan.nessus) or Nessus DB (scan.db). The .nessus file is an .xml file and includes a copy of the scan settings and plugin outputs. The .db file contains the .nessus file and the scan's KB, plugin Audit Trail, and any scan attachments. More information about the KB and Audit Trail can be found here.

Scripts such as the nessus-report-downloader can be used to quickly download scan results in all available formats from the CLI using the Nessus REST API:

./nessus_downloader.rb

We can also write our own scripts to automate many Nessus features.
